Pool net:
Pool net use multithreading parallel and random add episode in pool,which would make data being uncorrelated in pool,
then pools would be used parallel training agent.
Each thread have a pool.
Note have two types of pool net.

First type:
Each thread number would save in vector.

Second type:
Each thread number would save in matrix.

It also can be realized by higher dimension,but i haven't realized.
